There is no sign-up for this series—walk-ins are welcome and encouraged!\r\n\r\n# [Introduction to R, Part 1](#r1)\r\n### Sep. 8, 1:00–3:00 pm • DCL L440\r\n\r\nThis workshop targets students with some programming experience and little to no prior exposure to the statistical and data analysis language R.  We will conduct a hands-on walkthrough of basic R features and packages.\r\n\r\nWe will cover the following topics:\r\n\r\n- Reading and cleaning data\r\n- Major data types and their uses\r\n- Useful functions\r\n- Data display\r\n\r\n[How to install R Studio on EWS workstations](https://github.com/uiuc-cse/data-fa14/blob/gh-pages/lessons/install_Rstudio.md)\r\n\r\n[Link to lesson](https://github.com/uiuc-cse/data-fa14/blob/gh-pages/lessons/R1_intro.pdf?raw=true)\r\n\r\n[Link to exercises](https://github.com/uiuc-cse/data-fa14/blob/gh-pages/lessons/R1_exercises.pdf?raw=true)\r\n\r\n# [Introduction to R, Part 2](#r2)\r\n### Sep. 15, 1:00–3:00 pm • DCL L440\r\n\r\nThis tutorial continues the introduction to R begun previously, including new topics such as importing packages.\r\n\r\n[Link to lesson](https://github.com/uiuc-cse/data-fa14/blob/gh-pages/lessons/R2_intro.md)\r\n\r\n[Link to capstone exercise](https://github.com/uiuc-cse/data-fa14/blob/gh-pages/lessons/R2_exercise_capstone.pdf?raw=true)\r\n\r\n# [Pandas (Python Data Analysis) Library](#pandas)\r\n### Sep. 17, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n\r\nThe [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) module provides an R-like interface for manipulating and analyzing data sets and their statistics.\r\n\r\n# Introduction Big Data and Analytics (Seminar by Big Data and Analytics Council)\r\n### Sep. 25, 5:00 pm • 1002 Lincoln Hall\r\n\r\nAlthough not part of the CSE workshop series, we recommend this talk hosted by the student group Big Data and Analytics Council which will cover Big Data and its applications in a popular manner to those interested in applying data analysis techniques to their research and coursework.\r\n\r\n# [Data Mining Applications](#mining)\r\n### Sep. 29, 1:00–3:00 pm • DCL L440\r\n\r\n# [Machine Learning Applications](#ml)\r\n### Oct. 6, 1:00–3:00 pm • DCL L440\r\n\r\n# [Machine Learning in Python](#sklearn)\r\n### Oct. 22, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n\r\n# [IllinoisNLPCloud](#nlpcloud)\r\n### Oct. 23, 9:00–11:00 am • DCL L440\r\n\r\n_Presented by Dr Mark Sammons of the [Cognitive Computation Group](http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/).  Please note the updated date and time._\r\n\r\nCome learn how to perform cloud processing of natural language, whether your interest is business intelligence, computer science, computational linguistics, or text mining.  \r\n\r\n[IllinoisCloudNLP](http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/page/software) makes it straightforward for experts and nonexperts alike to process large texts as needed.\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n\r\nWe will follow the instructions [here](http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/revamp/pages/tutorial_cloudnlp.php?title=getting-started).  Unless you already have an [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) account, you will use a CSE training account assigned to you in the workshop.  (These have associated keys and access codes necessary for the workshop, and I will post a link here on the day of the workshop for you.)\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dropdown\">\r\n  <button class=\"btn btn-default dropdown-toggle\" type=\"button\" id=\"dropdownMenu1\" data-toggle=\"dropdown\">\r\n    Dropdown\r\n    <span class=\"caret\"></span>\r\n  </button>\r\n  <ul class=\"dropdown-menu\" role=\"menu\" aria-labelledby=\"dropdownMenu1\">\r\n    <li role=\"presentation\"><a role=\"menuitem\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#\">Action</a></li>\r\n    <li role=\"presentation\"><a role=\"menuitem\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#\">Another action</a></li>\r\n    <li role=\"presentation\"><a role=\"menuitem\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#\">Something else here</a></li>\r\n    <li role=\"presentation\" class=\"divider\"></li>\r\n    <li role=\"presentation\"><a role=\"menuitem\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#\">Separated link</a></li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n- On your EWS machine, please open a terminal window to work in and execute the following code:\r\n\r\n        module load sun-jdk/1.7.0-latest-el6-x86_64\r\n\r\n- Follow the instructions at the link above.\r\n\r\n-   When your terminal output reads\r\n\r\n        [info] play - Application started (Prod)\r\n        [info] play - Listening for HTTP on /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:9000\r\n\r\n    then navigate to [`http://127.0.0.1:9000/`](http://127.0.0.1:9000/).\r\n\r\n\r\n# [KNIME Graphical Analytics](#knime)\r\n### Oct. 27, 1:00–3:00 pm • DCL L440\r\n\r\nKNIME is an open platform for sophisticated data mining and statistics on your data.
